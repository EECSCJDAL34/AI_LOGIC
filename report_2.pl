APPENDIX: This report was jointly authored. We both worked on the outline of each 
	  question together as a pair. The programming of the predicates was jointly
	  done. Dinesh wrote the documentation and comments for each predicate while 
	  CJ wrote the test cases for each question.

EXERCISE 1

The predicate robot(Energy, SourceCity, DestinationCity, Path) asserts that Energy is
itself the energy at the SourceCity, and Path is a path from Source to Destination. The
robot cannot travel between two cities unless it has sufficient energy to make the 
trip. It is a variation of the maze problem (defined in class), where each edge 
predicate has a third argument that gives the amount of energy required to traverse the
edge.	

**********************************************************************************/

/***
Facts: 
The following facts construct a graph with 7 distinct nodes. Each edge connects a 
sourceCity (a source node) to a DestinationCity (a destination node). The weight of
each node is 1. This allows for easier tester since the calculations are manageable. 
All facts are of the form "X is connected to Y with weight Z" (i.e.) a is connected
to b with weight 1.

/***
Test Cases: 
Test the program on both valid and invalid list inputs. We focused on testing the base
cases and its respective boundary cases. We also focused on creating an exhaustive
list of test cases on correct and incorrect inputs. The test cases were used throughout
development to determine if any logical errors were present in our program. Every test
case below passes.

EXERCISE 2

The exercise gives a set of rules that pertain to 3 different individuals; Sandy, Chris
and Pat. It is known that each person has a different occupation and plays a different
musical instrument than the others. The set of rules given are as follows:

1. Chris is married to the doctor.
2. The lawyer plays the piano.
3. Chris is not the engineer.
4. Sandy is a patient of the violinist.

Question: "Who plays the flute?"

The predicate flute_player1(Flute_player, Table) asserts that Flute_player is one of
Sandy, Chris, or Pat and Table is a collection of rows that give a complete solution.
Table can be defined as Table=[[Sandy, Chris, Pat],[Doctor, Lawyer, Engineer],[Piano,
Violin, Flute]]. This is a variation of the find2 program defined in class. 

**********************************************************************************/

/***
Pen and Paper Solution: 
"Who plays the flute" can be solved easily with simple logical reasoning when following
the rules one by one. It is known that Chris is married to the doctor. Since marriage
has no influence on the occupation nor instrument they play, this rule can be
simplified to Chris /= Doctor. The next rule, the lawyer plays the piano, simply states
that the same person who is a lawyer must also play the piano. Thus, the rule can be
simplified to Lawyer = Piano. The following rule, Chris is not an engineer, can be
simplified to Chris /= Engineer. The last rule, Sandy is a patient of the violinist
implies that Sandy /= Doctor since one cannot be a patient of oneself and that the
Doctor = Violin(or that Sandy /= Doctor). 

Who Plays the Flute? 

It is known that both Chris /= Doctor and Sandy /= Doctor, therefore, it is implied
that Pat must be the doctor. Since Pat is the doctor and Doctor = Violin, it is easy
to conclude that Pat plays the violin and thus all information pertaining to Pat has
been found. Since Pat is a Doctor and Chris /= Engineer, Chris must be a Lawyer. It
is already known that the Lawyer = Piano, therefore, we can conclude that Chris
plays the piano. By the process of elimination, Sandy must be the flute player.

Chris			Pat			  Sandy
Lawyer			Doctor			  Engineer

EXERCISE 3

This exercise utilizes the same rules as defined in EXERCISE 2.

1. Chris is married to the doctor.
2. The lawyer plays the piano.
3. Chris is not the engineer.
4. Sandy is a patient of the violinist.

Question: "Who plays the flute?"

The predicate flute_player2(Flute_player, Table) asserts that Flute_player is one of
Sandy, Chris, or Pat and Table is a collection of rows that give a complete solution.
This solution is the same as the solution obtained in EXERCISE 2. This is a variation
of the find1 program defined in class. It uses the compound term column(Name,
Occupation, Instrument) for each column of the table, and then uses the values of 
the three columns to build the same table as defined in EXERCISE 2.

% columns as outlined above

/**
What is Wrong?
The flute player returns Pat and NOT Sandy which is obviously incorrect. Our
guess is that the errors come from the improper coding of the columns
specifically:

column(FlutePlayer, _, flute) on List,

We believe that one of the rules has implied the Pat is in fact the flute
player when he is not.
